## Arrays
- JavaScript arrays are resizable and can contain a mix of different data types.
- We can also call functions inside arrays element

















## Spread Operator
- it works on all the iterables like `arrays` , `strings` , `maps` , `sets` but it also works on `object` eventhough it is not iterables
- spread operator is like destructuring , the differnce is spread operator takes all the element out and does not create new variable.
- we can only use spread operator while building an array or while passing it to a functions
